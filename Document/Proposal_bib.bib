abstract="In the Generalized Travelling Salesman Problem (GTSP), the aim is to determine a least cost Hamiltonian circuit or cycle through several clusters of vertices. It is shown that a wide variety of combinatorial optimization problems can be modelled as GTSPs. These problems include location-routeing problems, material flow system design, post-box collection, stochastic vehicle routeing and arc routeing.",
